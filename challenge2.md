# Challenge 2 of 7: Review the Starter Code

## ✅ Checkpoint

Great work on that Git quiz! Are you feeling more confident about using Git for your coding projects? In this
challenge, you'll check out the starter code we've provided you with in order to set yourself up for the
upcoming challenges.

You can run the starter code to view the website using the recommended Live Server plugin by right-
clicking within the **index.html** file and then selecting "Open with Live Server". Here's a screenshot showing
how to start the Live Server:

At this point, your site should look like the exemplar below - you won't have made any changes yet, but you
will in just a moment!

## 🥏 Challenge Steps

➡➡➡ **Step 1: Examine games.js**

1. Check out the **games.js** file in your repo. The file contains data about games that have been
    crowdfunded. You will be working on a site that displays and summarizes this data in unique and
    interesting ways. This data is in JSON format, which is shorthand for Javascript Object Notation.
    You can read more about JSON format here.

While you are reviewing **games.js** , you may want to consider the following questions:

```
● What type of information is stored in the constant games?
● How many properties does each game have?
● What does each different property represent?
● How many games are there?
```
There are two properties whose purpose may not be obvious:

```
● backers holds a number referring to the number of unique people who have donated to fund a game
● pledged holds a dollar amount referring to the amount of money backers have donated to the game
```
🔑 **Secret Key component 1** : How many properties does each game have? (Answer as a **number** , not a
word.)

➡➡➡ **Step 2: Examine index.html**

1. Check out **index.html**. Run a live server if possible to view the website in its current state.

🔑 **Secret Key component 2** : What is the id of the HTML element that will display a list of all games?

➡➡➡ **Step 3: Check out style.css**

1. Examine **index.css**.
2. Add a CSS rule for the **stats-container** s.
3. Add flexbox to the **stats-container** s. You'll want to make sure to add CSS for both **display** and **align-
items**. Need a flexbox refresher? Check out the resources below!
4. Add a CSS rule for **stats-container** that sets the cursor to pointer and box-shadow to **0 0 30px
lightblue** on hover.

🔑 **Secret Key component 3** : Which selector would select all elements with the **stats-card** class?

**Resources**

```
● Pseudoselectors refresher
● CSS Selectors reference
● Flexbox reference
```
➡➡➡ **Step 4: Examine the starter code in index.js**

1. Examine the starter code in **index.js**. Note that you will be using the **GAMES_JSON** variable throughout
    the rest of the challenges.

🔑 **Secret Key component 4** : Which line number in **index.js** contains the start of a loop? (Answer as a
number, not a word.)

## 🚀 Moving on to Challenge 3

Create the 🔑 Secret Key from its components with no spaces in between:

```
● Component 1: How many attributes does each game have?
● Component 2: What is the id of the HTML element that will display a list of all games?
● Component 3: Which selector would select all elements with the stats-card class? Include the full
selector (in other words, what would you write if defining a CSS rule for these elements?).
● Component 4: Which line number in index.js contains the start of a loop?
```
**Hint:** your 🔑 **Secret Key** should be 29 characters long.

Reminders about 🔑 **Secret Keys** :

```
● Keys for the Offline PDF version of prework are case sensitive!
○ (For example, “SEA_MONSTER” is NOT the same as "sea_monster")
● Secret keys can be any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
```
Use your 🔑 **Secret Key** to unlock the next PDF file. If your 🔑 **Secret Key** is correct, you will move onto the
next step!
